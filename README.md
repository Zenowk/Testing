This repo is an example of making and testing a shell script while using git. What is included in this repo is my backup.sh and README.md. The script was made using the nano editor. I did have difficulties figuring out how to use the editor as it was my first time, it took a few tries writing a test script for me to start writing the backup.sh. Comments were added to define what some commands were doing in the script. Source used https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners. 

Code Review (Benjamin Baldwin)
Overall, I thought that your code was very well written. You included line comments to describe what the code was doing, and I added to them in my own comments. You indented properly when needed, and used the correct syntax for Bash scripting. The one thing that I can suggest for improvement is that maybe the while and until loops can be implemented in the backup script? When I reviewed your code, I didn't find errors in the code, and everything was indented properly. Great work on the scripts, David!
